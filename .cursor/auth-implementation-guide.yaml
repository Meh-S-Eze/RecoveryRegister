best_practices:
  - "Never store unencrypted sensitive data in client-accessible storage"
  - "Provide clear opt-in for identity disclosure"
  - "Use security profiles to enable gradual feature rollout"
  - "Keep crypto implementation modular for easy upgrades"
  - "Sanitize all data before sending to client"
  - "Use pseudonyms as first-class identity objects"

implementation_strategy:
  phase1:
    - "Basic auth config and user model"
    - "Pseudonym registration flow"
    - "Session encryption (basic)"
  phase2:
    - "Email verification (optional)"
    - "Security profile management"
    - "Client-side data sanitization"
  phase3:
    - "Upgrade paths to advanced security"
    - "Recovery-specific features"
