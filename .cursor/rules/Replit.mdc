title: Replit SSH Project Guidelines


environment:
  type: replit_ssh
  description: "Project hosted on Replit, being edited remotely via SSH"

file_synchronization:
  # Based on https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/ssh
  behavior: "bidirectional"
  notes: "Changes made in local editor are instantly synced to Replit and vice versa"

editor_awareness:
  possible_editors:
    - vscode_remote_ssh
    - local_terminal
    - emacs
    - vim
    - other_local_ide
  guidance: "Respect user's editor setup and preferences when suggesting changes"

replit_specifics:
  container_nature: true
  proxy_routing: true
  filesystem_persistence: true
  x11_forwarding_compatibility: "May conflict with Replit Graphics feature"

development_workflow:
  considerations:
    - "Automatic file synchronization occurs between Replit and local editor"
    - "File management operations (add/delete/move) are synchronized in real-time"
    - "Folder structure changes propagate across environments"
    - "VSCode configuration is persisted in the Repl's filesystem"

debugging_guidance:
  remote_nature: "Remember code is executing in Replit container, not locally"
  port_access: "Web services running in Replit container are accessible via Replit URLs"
  
security_considerations:
  garage_project: true
  security_level: "relaxed"
